Anderson Sabogal holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National University of Colombia. In 2017 he started a master's in the same field at the UPV, Valencia (Spain). During the master’s courses, he participated in two editions of the Hyperloop Pod Competition organized in Los Angeles, California, by the aerospace company SpaceX (2018-2019) . In the first edition, he was a mechanical designer, and later he took on the role of technical director; in the Hyperloop UPV team. For two consecutive years the team finished within the top 10 places, among more than 500 participating universities.
Starting in 2019, he spent 28 months as an R&D mechanical engineer in Zeleros, a Spanish company responsible of develop Hyperloop technologies. During the same period, he started a Masters of Advanced Physics at the University of Valencia, where he look at Deep Technology that could be implemented in Hyperloop. Consequently, he became interested in topics related to energy, in particular nuclear fusion, and therefore, at the beginning of 2022’ he joined the Department of Nuclear, Atomic, and Molecular Physic, at the University of Granada, where now is researching his Ph.-d. for the IFMIF-DONES project (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility - Demo Oriented Neutron Source), a particle accelerator able to provide the irradiation needed to get commercial fusion in 2040.

Projects
------
**IFMIF-DONES**

The International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility – Demo Oriented NEutron Source (IFMIF-DONES) is a single-sited novel research infrastructure for testing, validation and qualification of the materials to be used in future fusion power plants like DEMO (a demonstration fusion reactor prototype).

My role on this project was on the reseach of: Simulation and Experimental Study of Vacuum-Loss Accidental Scenarios in the IFMIF-DONES Accelerator using the MuVacAS Facility.

**Hyperloop - Zeleros**

Hyperloop is the world’s fastest land transport system for fully electric and automated intercity travel. Hyperloop capsules move levitating at high speeds inside a network of low-pressure tubes.
