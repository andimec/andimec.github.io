title: "Optimization of parameters in material selection of tricone drill bit head design."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Optimization
excerpt: 'The tricone drill bit head is one of the main components in petroleum perforation settings because it makes possible to break the soil to establish a flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. For this reason.. it is a component that requires special analysis. This work investigates the optimization process of the parameters used in the material selection for a tricone drill bit. It includes the material selection for the bit body and the inserts. The stresses to which the drill is subjected during drilling are calculated and conditions to be fulfilled are established according to its function.'

The tricone drill bit head is one of the main components in petroleum perforation settings because it makes possible to break the soil to establish a flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. For this reason.. it is a component that requires special analysis. This work investigates the optimization process of the parameters used in the material selection for a tricone drill bit. It includes the material selection for the bit body and the inserts. The stresses to which the drill is subjected during drilling are calculated and conditions to be fulfilled are established according to its function.
