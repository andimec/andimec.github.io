excerpt: 'In this paper.. a static test bench to characterize the performance of a linear motor designed for a hyperloop system is proposed. This bench allows a 3D movement of the traslator in order to take measurements on all the states that the system can reach. The results from the conducted test have demonstrated a low deviation between the experimental and simulated value of the forces.'

In this paper.. a static test bench to characterize the performance of a linear motor designed for a hyperloop system is proposed. This bench allows a 3D movement of the traslator in order to take measurements on all the states that the system can reach. The results from the conducted test have demonstrated a low deviation between the experimental and simulated value of the forces.
