<h1> Experience in Superconductivity Practical Days at CERN </h1>
Hey everyone! Just got back from an incredible experience at CERN's Superconductivity Practical Days, and let me tell you, it was mind-blowing! For those who don't know, superconductivity is basically when a material turns into a superconductor â€“ think zero electrical resistance and super strong magnetic fields. It's what powers some pretty amazing things, from MRI machines to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator.

At CERN, I got to dive deep into the world of superconductivity firsthand. We learned about all the different applications, from the gigantic LHC magnets to the delicate electronics used in scientific detectors. But the coolest part? We got to get our hands dirty with some practical work!
