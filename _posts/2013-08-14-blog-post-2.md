Visiting The PSI
======
Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland and explore their incredible Proton Therapy Center. PSI is a world leader in scientific research, and their proton therapy facility is at the forefront of cancer treatment. Unlike traditional radiation therapy, which uses X-rays, proton therapy uses beams of protons – tiny charged particles – to target tumors with pinpoint accuracy.  This minimizes damage to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor, leading to potentially fewer side effects for patients.

Let me show you the hidden face of this impressive machine.

How does Proton Therapy work?

Basic principles of Proton Therapy: how does it work?

Unlike traditional radiotherapy that uses photons to irradiate and kill tumor cells, proton therapy is an advanced form of treatment using protons. These particles give proton therapy its many advantages: 
- Fewer radiation outside the tumor;
- Less side effects
- Lower risk of induced disorders;
- Better quality of life during and after cancer treatment.
