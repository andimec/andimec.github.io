<h1> Phd Fusion Event </h1>


<h1> Nuclear fusion explained in 2 minutes (Spanish version) </h1>

I share the passion for science and technology everywhere, and thanks to having participated in the Phd Fusion Event of the FuseNet Association I was able to meet very interesting people and thanks to this we were able to bring this video to more languages, in my case I was able to contribute with the translation into Spanish.
