title: "Static test bench for a linear motor using a 3-axis Load-Cell"
excerpt: "static test bench to characterize the performance of a linear motor designed for a hyperloop system is proposed. This bench allows a 3D movement of the traslator in order to take measurements on all the states that the system can reach. <br/><img src='/images/CADSTB.png'>"

This test bench is a real scale lineal motor, using the same input power and dimensions. The actual power to propel the real hyperloop capsule will require several of these modules.
Several designs of static test bench have been published, but none of them allow measuring the three force components in the traslator, which is necessary to evaluate dynamic behavior of the vehicle.
