As a physics instructor, I’ve seen firsthand how course content can quickly become outdated, especially in a world where technological advancements move faster than textbooks. It's frustrating to witness students study concepts without the opportunity to apply them in real-world scenarios. This disconnect between theory and practice often leaves them unprepared for the dynamic challenges they will face in their careers.

That’s why I decided to take action with the launch of the Fusion Student Challenge—a project designed to bring students out of the classroom and into the cutting-edge world of fusion energy research.

<h1> Why Fusion? <h1> 
Fusion energy represents one of the most promising solutions to the global energy crisis, but it's also one of the most complex. By giving students the opportunity to engage directly with the technology and challenges of fusion energy, we’re not only helping to prepare the next generation of engineers and scientists but also contributing to the future of sustainable energy.

<h1> Fusion Student Challenge </h1>
Detailed design of the dipole magnet can be read on the below document:

<script type="text/javascript">
	document.addEventListener("adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready", function(){ 
     var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({clientId: "364a2ca09abc47fb9916ea7f7d5f1219", divId: "adobe-dc-view"});
      adobeDCView.previewFile(
     {
         content:  {location: {url: "https://andimec.github.io/files/1st_Fusion_Student_Challenge_Public.pdf"}},
         metaData: {fileName: "1st_Fusion_Student_Challenge_Public.pdf"}
		}, {embedMode: "IN_LINE"});
	});

<h1> Hands-On Learning: Fusor de Farnsworth</h1>

The goal of this challenge is simple: let students get their hands dirty by designing and building practical solutions. The Fusion Student Challenge will push students to work collaboratively on real-world problems, developing critical skills that will serve them throughout their careers. We know that this project will take time, so together with a group of students we wanted to start with something simple, and for this we want to build a Fusor of Farnsworth
