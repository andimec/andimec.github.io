The MuVacAS Experimental Setup has been developed with the aim of recreating vacuum-related accidental scenarios that may occur in the IFMIF-DONES facility. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of safety-credited components in mitigating these scenarios, which is directly related to the study of shock-wave generation and propagation in loss of vacuum accidents.
