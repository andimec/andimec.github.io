<h2> Introduction </h2>
MedAustron is a proton therapy facility based in Austria. The development of this facility requires several beam manipulation devices such as magnets, RF cavities, correctors, and steerers. 
Dipole magnets allow medical professionals to selectively steer protons and other ions of specific energy to have precise control over therapy. This selective control allows radiation to be targeted at a specific spot, resulting in highly effective treatment of diseases such as cancer. 
The method to optimize the beam profile uses the loop Matlab/octave with magnetical simulation called FEMM.
