<h1> Introduction </h1>
MedAustron is a proton therapy facility based in Austria. The development of this facility requires several beam manipulation devices such as Magnets, RF cavities, correctors, steerers, etc. 
Dipole magnets allows medical professionals to selectively steer proton and other ions of specific energy to have a precise control over therapy. This selective control allows for radiation to be targeted at a specific spot and thus results in a highly effective treatment of diseases such as cancer. 
The method to optimize the beam profile use the loop of the Matlab/octave program with the magnetical simulation software called FEMM.
